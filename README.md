# 0–100 Tracker

A modern acceleration leaderboard for cars. Every car has a 0–100 km/h time and the
app ranks them automatically, fastest to slowest. Add, edit, and delete cars,
attach images and videos, and the board re-ranks itself the moment a time changes.

**Position is computed, never stored** — ranks are always derived by sorting cars
ascending by `zeroToHundred` on read.

## Stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router) + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** components
- **Framer Motion** — layout animations for smooth row re-ordering
- **MongoDB** + **Mongoose** (cached global connection for dev hot-reloads)
- **zod** + **react-hook-form** — typed, validated forms
- **Cloudinary** — image/video storage (signed server-side uploads)

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local      # then edit MONGODB_URI
npm run seed                    # load the starter grid
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:3000
```

Set `MONGODB_URI` in `.env.local` to a local MongoDB (`mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/zero-to-hundred`)
or an Atlas connection string, and add your **Cloudinary** credentials
(`CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`) from the
[Cloudinary dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console) so media uploads work.

## Data model

A `Car` has: `modelYear`, `manufacturer`, `carModel`, `engineSize` (L),
`powertrainType` (Petrol · Petrol / Hybrid · Petrol / Plug-In Hybrid · Diesel),
`transmission` (Auto · Manual), `induction` (NA · Turbocharged),
`zeroToHundred` (seconds), and `media[]` of `{ type: 'image' | 'video', path }`.
Timestamps are enabled. `position` is computed on read, never persisted.

## Admin access

Viewing the leaderboard is public. Adding, editing, and deleting cars (and
managing media) requires the admin passcode. Set `ADMIN_PASSCODE` and a random
`SESSION_SECRET` in `.env.local`, then visit `/login` and enter the passcode —
this sets a signed, httpOnly session cookie (7-day expiry).

Enforcement is layered:

- **Write APIs** (`POST/PUT/DELETE /api/cars`, `PATCH …/thumbnail`,
  `POST /api/upload`) call `requireApiAuth()` and return **401** without a valid
  session — the real gate.
- **`middleware.ts`** issues a **307** redirect to `/login` for `/cars/new` and
  `/cars/[id]/edit` before they render.
- **UI** hides Add / Edit / Delete / "Set as thumbnail" unless signed in.

Generate a secret with:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

## Media storage (Cloudinary)

Uploads flow through the `/api/upload` route handler, which calls
`lib/storage.ts`. There, `saveFiles` streams each file to Cloudinary (signed,
server-side — your API secret never reaches the browser) and returns
`{ type, path }` where `path` is the Cloudinary secure URL stored on the car.
`deleteManyMedia` removes assets when a car is deleted or its media is dropped
during an edit. To swap providers (S3, local disk, …) replace the bodies in
`lib/storage.ts` and keep the signatures — no callers change.
